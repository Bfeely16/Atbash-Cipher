# Mathmatical analysis 
Every letter in the alphabet can be 25 different letters hence it the number of possible keys should be 2625.

If you didint have a key it would be very diffuclt to figure out but not impossible. IF you had enough time and enough computers you could figure it out. 

The mathmatical complexity is not very hard beucase its letters and not numbers
